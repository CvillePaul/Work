Program Summary:
Targets are TESS identified eclipsing quadruple systems (2 sets of Eclipsing Binaries, each showing both a Primary and Secondary Eclipse).  

Our goal for this observing session is to obtain unambiguous radial velocity measurements for these systems.
We therefore seek observations when one of the two binary systems is in eclipse and the other is halfway between eclipses.
